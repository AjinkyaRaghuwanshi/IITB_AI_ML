	Generic memory pool specification
		Madhav Desai


1. Overview
-----------
	
	The generic memory pool provides storage capacity
	for the AI/ML system.   The memory pool is characterized
	by the following

	a.  the amount of storage.
	b.  the page size for the storage.
	c.  the number of requesters.

2. Behaviour
-------------

	The memory pool responds to requests from requesters.
	The requests are as follows
		
	a. allocate request:
		requests allocation of a buffer of necessarily contiguous 
		pages.  The memory pool responds with a buffer pointer
		or an invalid value if it is not possible to allocate
		such a buffer.

	b. read request:
		Given a pointer, read a burst of double-words from the
		pointer (as a starting address) and return the burst
		to the requester.

	c. write request:
		Given a pointer and the dwords to be written, write those
		dwords to the addresses specified.  A byte-mask is provided
		for the last dword to be written.

	d. de-allocate request:
		requests de-allocation of a previously granted buffer.


3. Internal organization
-------------------------

	Internally, the memory pool is organized into the following
	functional blocks
	
	a.  input ports
	
	b.  interconnection network

	c.  memory banks
		These can be of two types
			- internal RAM 
			- external RAM (typically DRAM)..


4. Performance parameters
--------------------------

	a. latency

		should not exceed memory latency by more
		than 16 clock cycles.

	b. throughput.

		should be > 0.5X peak bandwidth 
		across all requesters. 

	

5. Cost
-------------------------

	Should be 

		sub-quadratic in the number of requesters.

		linear in the memory size.
